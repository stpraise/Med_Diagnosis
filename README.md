# AI-MedDiagnostics

AI MedDiagnostic is a web-based application that allows users to track their symptoms and predict the likelihood of having a disease based on their symptoms. The application supports various diseases such as Dengue, Heart-Attack, Paralysis, Hypertension, Chronic Kidney Disease, Heart Disease, and COVID-19. Users can enter their symptoms into the application, and the system will use machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of having a disease. The application also has features like Personal Health Care Assistance, which provides personalized health care advice based on the user's symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle.



## Features

* Easy to use interface for symptom tracking
* Predictive analysis of disease based on symptoms entered
* Support for various diseases
* Real-time feedback on disease likelihood
* Personal Health Care Assistance
* COVID-19 Detection

## Technologies Used

1. Python Flask
2. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/stpraise/Med_Diagnosis.git
2. Create virtual environment: python -m venv .venv

3. Activate the virtual environment: source .venv/Scripts/activate

4. py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Run the application: python app.py and python "model_name.py" to train all the models in the project

## Usage

* Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5000
* Enter your symptoms into the input form
* Click on the "Predict" button to get the prediction
* The system will display the likelihood of having a particular disease based on the symptoms entered.

## Personal Health Care Assistance

The Personal Health Care Assistance feature allows users to get personalized health care advice based on their symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle. The system uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze user data and provide personalized advice on diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes to improve their overall health.



## COVID-19 Detection

The COVID-19 Detection feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having COVID-19. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having COVID-19.


## Additional Features

- Chronic Kidney Disease Detection
The Chronic Kidney Disease Detection feature uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having the disease. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including fatigue, nausea, shortness of breath, and more. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having Chronic Kidney Disease.

- Heart Disease Detection
The Heart Disease Detection feature also uses machine learning algorithms to analyze symptoms and predict the likelihood of having the disease. The system takes input from the user about symptoms they are facing, including chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and more. The input is then processed by the system, which uses a machine learning model to determine the likelihood of having Heart Disease.
